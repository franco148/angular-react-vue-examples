# angular-react-vue-examples
Reviewing differences (main characteristics) between Angular5 vs ReactJS vs VueJs.

  
### 1: THE LEARNING CURVE
#### INITIAL STAGE
###### Angular
- Needed to understand about Angular CLI, which add some complex because we have to understand its workflow, why we need the CLI, why we need to create a project like this that we have all the different modules, and components and different files and that. There for we need a workflow which transports typescript and which merges all the files (fats) into a basic bundle.
- Needed to have knowledge regarding to TypeScript
###### ReactJs
- It uses ES6 and JSX we will need to learn about it, and maybe it is not easy to start.
- It recommends strongly ES6 but is not absolutelly necesary. Because then everything is javascript.
- There is JSX which is an HTML like code in javascript that can be tough to understand. However it is not so difficult when we got it, but having this first point this can be difficult.
###### VueJs
- It uses ES5 (Vanilla Javascript) & "Controlling the DOM"
- It just needs a reference to its CDN for starting an initial project.
- We can use ES6 in our workflow, but nothing is wrong using ES5.
- We start simply controlling a part of the DOM and then using the VueJS syntax which is straightforward to understand at the beginning.


#### DIVING DEEPER STAGE
###### Angular
- We have to understand how components, modules and the syntax works and how all these pieces work together. This seems to have a doable step, but still it is something we have to get into. We have to understand the way angular works.
- It might not be as hard as understanding how the project works, how the angular APIs started and why we use TypeScript. But still it is not super easy.
###### ReactJs
- We still need kind of understand that everything is javascript and the first time we try to render content conditionally or we try to output a list of items, it can be tough to understand that all we use are normal javascript functions or methods like for example the map method on an array to render out elements.
- Once got it, again it is not that hard but it is something we have to understand.
###### VueJs
- We are getting a bit more advanced.
- We might start using our local workflow with webpack, so we can use ES6 and have it compile to ES5, and we might start using these the ```.vue``` files to have an easier way of writing components in the end. But again we have to understand that at first we have to understand that ```.vue``` files give us more features because they are compiled to javascript code in our workflow and not compiled in the browser as we did with the very first step.


#### BUILDING APPs STAGE
###### Angular
- We will need to understand about State Management
###### ReactJs
- We will need to understand about State Management
- It is recommended state management patterns like redux which is great but again we have to learn these.
- Again that is quite an effort to make that step. 
###### VueJs
- Component orchestration, communication & routing
- We also need to understand how components may communicate and how we build our apps with components, state management however is a bit easier.
- There is a package called  VueX which is by the creators of VueJs and which integrates nicely into it. And therefore whilst being something we have to learn is not that difficult to learn in the end.


#### DEPLOYMENT STAGE
###### Angular
- It really taking off there are tons of optimizations we can do, and we unfortunately have to do to get an application which really is small and offers the best performance.
- It is not worse from a performance perspective necessarily but getting it to perform nicely and optimizing it for production might be more difficult.
###### ReactJs
- It is easier than angular.
- Has some tools that helps to decrease the bundle size, split up our bundles and optimize the apps.
- But out of the box, these frameworks work better we can say.
###### VueJs
- It is easier than angular.
- Has some tools that helps to decrease the bundle size, split up our bundles and optimize the apps.
- But out of the box, these frameworks work better we can say.
